How to use git with github:

In order to clone, run:

# git clone https://github.com/wildertm/jytwai

In order to add files, run:

# git add .

In order to commit:

# git commit -a

In order to push your changes to the web repo:

# git push origin

Workflow:

With github, you can only submit one pull request from a branch, so whenever you make a change - make it in a branch before you submit 
the pull request.

git branch temp
git checkout temp
#make changes, git commit -a, etc.
git push origin temp
#go to the website, make a pull request
#When you want to delete the branch locally...
git tag V1.0 # in order to save it in history
git checkout master
git reset --hard temp
git branch -D temp
#In order to delete it from the remote repo
git push origin --delete temp
